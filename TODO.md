# TODO

## Must do before release
* export playlist
* think of a better name + logo/favicon
* landing page w/ screenshots (with good SEO practices)
* if mobile device detected, display friendly "This site isn't optimized for mobile devices yet" message

## Nice-to-haves
* show a singleton toast notification when:
  * track(s) added: "Added track to playlist" / "Added {n} tracks to playlist"
  * track(s) deleted: "Deleted track" / "Deleted all tracks"
  * playlist exported: "Successfully exported to "{n}"" 
* persist in-progress playlists remotely (i.e. in s3, on a per-spotify-user basis)
* navigate through search results with up/down arrow
* mobile responsiveness
