# TODO

## Must do before release
* implement analysis view
* use authorization code flow instead of implicit grant, so that sessions last longer
* export playlist
* think of a better name + logo/favicon
* landing page w/ screenshots (with good SEO practices)
* mobile responsiveness

## Nice-to-haves
* persist in-progress playlists remotely (i.e. in s3, on a per-spotify-user basis)
* navigate through search results with up/down arrow
